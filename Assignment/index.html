                <p id="para">Heart bypass surgery, also known as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), is a common and highly effective medical procedure for treating coronary artery disease. 
                    This condition occurs when the blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients become narrow or blocked, often due to the buildup of cholesterol and other substances.
                     <br>
                    During a heart bypass procedure, a surgeon creates new pathways for blood flow by using a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body or a synthetic graft. 
                    This "bypass" allows blood to reach the heart muscle, bypassing the blocked or narrowed arteries.

                        leading to chest pain (angina) or increasing the risk of a heart attack. </p>

                    <p>Heart bypass surgery, medically known as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), is a life-saving procedure used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD). 
                        CAD occurs when the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients become narrow or blocked, often due to the buildup of cholesterol and plaque.

                        During a heart bypass surgery, a cardiothoracic surgeon creates new pathways for blood to flow to the heart muscle by using grafts, which are typically segments of healthy blood vessels from other parts of the body, such as the leg or chest. 
                        These grafts bypass the obstructed or narrowed coronary arteries, restoring proper blood flow to the heart.
                        
                        The surgery is performed under general anesthesia, and the patient's heart is temporarily stopped while a heart-lung machine takes over its function. 
                        The surgeon then carefully attaches the grafts, rerouting blood around the blocked arteries. </p>
